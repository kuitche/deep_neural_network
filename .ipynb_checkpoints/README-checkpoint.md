# Background
As a risk management person, we're asked you to help a model that predicts whether funding applications from startups will become successful.
We're given a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from a company over the years. This file contains various types of information about the organizations, including whether they ultimately became successful. With knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become successful.

# Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is create a binary classification model using a deep neural network to predict whether applicants will be successful.
The following tasks will be performed:
* Preprocess data for a neural network model.
* Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
* Optimize the model.
